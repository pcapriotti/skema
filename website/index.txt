h2. Introduction

*skema* is a command line utility for expanding templates.
It can be used in a number of ways. Examples include:
* fast prototyping applications in frameworks that require a lot of boilerplate code;
* adding copyright statements to source files;
* automating repetitive coding tasks.

Of course, there's nothing in skema that you can't find in your favourite text
editor's templating facility; skema just makes it easier if you happen to like
the command line.

skema uses the ERB templating library included with ruby, but you don't need
to know ruby or ERB to use it. See the 'Creating templates' section below for
more details on how to add your own templates.

h2. Installing

<pre>
sudo gem install skema
skema -i skemaconfig . filename:.skemarc
</pre>

and answer the questions.

h2. Tutorial

skema comes with a couple of predefined templates. For example, the 'gpl'
template adds a copyright statement at the beginning of a C++ file. To try it
out, pick a source file test.cpp and run:

<pre>
$ skema gpl test.cpp
-> ./test.cpp
</pre>

Now take a look at test.cpp and you'll notice that a nice GPL header with your
name and email has been added.
But what if you want to use a different name and/or email for the license?
No problem, just set some arguments on the command line:
<pre>$ skema gpl test.cpp "name:John Doe" email:john.doe@example.com</pre>

The 'gpl' template, however, is somewhat peculiar in that it acts on a single,
already existing file. Most of the times, you want to expand a template on a 
new directory, populating it with files. Let's take the _kapp_ template, that
expands to an empty KDE4 application:

<pre>
$ skema kapp myapp
ERROR: Missing argument title
</pre>

What happened? Well, skema complains because it requires an argument and it
has no way to infer it without asking.

<pre>
$ skema kapp myapp title:MyApp
ERROR: Missing argument name
</pre>

Now the name is missing:

<pre>
$ skema kapp myapp title:MyApp name:myapp
-> CMakeLists.txt
-> main.cpp
-> ./myappui.rc
</pre>

Ok. It worked! Note that skema has an interactive mode, useful when you don't
know (or don't remember) the required args:

<pre>
$ skema -i kapp myapp
email [p.capriotti@gmail.com]:
version [0.1]:
title: MyApp
name: myapp
author [Paolo Capriotti]:
-> CMakeLists.txt
-> main.cpp
-> ./myappui.rc
</pre>

Just press enter at the prompt when you want to use the default.



h2. Creating templates

Let's create a *class* template, that expands to a C++ class file.

# Create a <code>class</code> directory in <code>$HOME/.skema</code>
# Inside the <code>class</code> directory, create a file called <code>class.rb</code> with something like:<pre>template :class => nil</pre>
# Create a 'templates' directory inside 'class'
# Create a file called 'h' with the following content:<pre>
<%= filename @class.downcase + ".cpp" %>
#ifndef <%= @class.upcase %>_H
#define <%= @class.upcase %>_H

class <%= @class %> {
public:
  <%= @class %>();
  virtual ~<%= @class %>();
};

#endif
</pre>
# Create a file called <code>cpp</code>. Content left as an exercise :)
# Try out your new template with<pre>
$ skema class . class:Test
</pre> you should then get two files: <code>test.h</code> and <code>test.cpp</code>.
