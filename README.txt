skema is a command line utility for expanding templates.
It can be used in a number of ways. Examples include:
* fast prototyping applications in frameworks that require a lot of boilerplate code;
* adding copyright statements to source files;
* automating repetitive coding tasks.

Of course, there's nothing in skema that you can't find in your favourite text
editor's templating facility; skema just makes it easier if you happen to like
the command line.
